<h2>EDITOR'S PORTFOLIO.</h2>


<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The present number begins the
eighteenth half-yearly volume of "The
Nursery;" and we are happy to inform
our friends that the magazine was never
so successful as it is to-day. Thus far, we
have entered upon every new volume with
an increased circulation. We look for a
still larger increase in the future; for
there are thousands and thousands of children
not yet supplied with the work, for
whom no other magazine can take its
place. We have something in preparation
for coming numbers which will make the
eyes of our little readers sparkle with
delight. Now is the time for canvassers
to go to work with a will.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The illustration by Merrill of the
"Three Little Culprits" who were kept
after school to study their spelling-lesson,
is one of those happy touches of nature
that every one can appreciate. The poem
by Miss Wadsworth is worthy of the picture.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Children who are trying to learn
to draw, will be pleased with the beautiful
subject in our present number. By giving
half-an-hour a day to drawing now, they
will acquire a facility and a skill that will
not only be of service to them, but a great
pleasure to them, all their lives.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">If parents or teachers would like
to know of two books by the use of which
teaching may be made a pleasure instead
of a task to children, they cannot do better
than order "The Easy Book" and "The
Beautiful Book;" the former containing
pieces in prose, and the latter, pieces in
verse, and both of them richly and copiously
illustrated with appropriate pictures.
These books are published at "The Nursery"
office by John L. Shorey.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Children who enjoy making paper
dolls, will find an advertisement at the
end of this number which is worthy of
attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">unny</span> was a little rabbit, the youngest
of a large family. His home was in an
old wood, where the trees were very
high, and wild-flowers grew in great
abundance. His mother had given him
to understand that he must not stray away from her,
lest he should get lost, and not be able to find her.</p>

<p>But Bunny, like some young children, was self-willed.
He thought his mother was over-careful; and so, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
one day, when nobody was watching him, he slipped away
from her, and sat down amid the grass, under two high
beech-trees.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">He heard his mother calling him, but took no notice of
her call. It was a warm summer day, and he fell asleep.
Soon he was startled by the loud barking of dogs. He woke
up, and, oh, how frightened he was!</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Luckily for him, the dogs did not come where he lay
crouching; for their masters were shooting birds, not rabbits.
Bunny thought the best thing he could do now was
to scamper back to his mother, his brothers and sisters as
fast as he could.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">But it was not quite so easy to find them again. No
sooner had he got into the open path than a troop of boys
caught sight of him; and at once there was a volley of
stones from their hands. By rare good luck he was not hit
by the stones. But he had not gone many paces farther,
when a man with a gun shot at him. Happily the man
missed his aim, and the shot went into some bushes.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Having escaped this new danger, Bunny leaped swiftly
over the high grass, till he came to the fallen trunk of a
tree. Here he hoped to find his mother; but, ah! there
was no trace of her to be seen. Night came on; and poor
Bunny had to lie down all alone and go to sleep.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The next morning it rained heavily; and Bunny crept
into the hollow trunk of the tree, where he could keep warm
and dry. But before noon the sun came out beautifully;
and the little rabbit, being very hungry, ran out.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The first thing he saw was his mother and the rest of the
family eating their dinner. Oh, how glad he was! His
mother did not scold him, but gave him plenty to eat; and
he made up his mind, that he never would run away again
from so good a mother.</p>

<h2>A TUG EXCURSION.</h2>


<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">It</span> was just after dinner when papa said, "Put on your
hats quickly, and we will go down to the dock, and perhaps
we shall find a tug going out."</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Ralph had something beside his hat to put on; for, contrary
to mamma's orders, he had taken off his shoes and
stockings. But, with good Maggie's help, that wrong was
speedily righted, and we were soon on our way to the dock.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">There we found the stanch tug "Williams" just ready
to leave. We jumped on board. The ropes were cast off;
and a few turns of the wheel took us out on the broad
expanse of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">How delighted we all were with the beautiful picture there
spread out before us!&#8212;the broad blue waters, dotted here
and there with white sails; far away to the right, the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
arising from a huge steamer on her way from Chicago to
Buffalo; and away, away, straight ahead of us, two white
specks, which Captain Charley told us were the vessels
he was going out for.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">A look through the glass proved that the "specks" were
<i>really</i> vessels, and huge ones too. While we were looking
and talking, what do you suppose one of the men brought
forward for Ralph's amusement?&#8212;A dog? No. A kitty?
No. A parrot? No. I think you will have to give it
up. A bear! Just the cunningest little bear any one ever
saw.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">He was just about the size of a tan-terrier, and so full of
play, that he got himself into all sorts of shapes, and performed
all the antics imaginable. But the most laughable
thing was to see him as a tight-rope performer. I am sure
he outdid any circus actor who ever travelled.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Ralph thought it jolly to play with a live bear. As one
would suppose, the bear was a great pet with all on board
the tug. He had always been handled with kindness; and
the captain told us he had never yet bitten any one.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">All this time, we are nearing the vessels we are to tow
back. See what a huge cable is thrown out to join the
vessels to the tug. Here we go, homeward bound.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">We must not forget to tell of the nice race we had with
the steam barge "Reitz," and how Ralph shouted when we
came out ahead; nor about Ralph's getting hungry, and
going down into the cabin, and making friends with the
cook, and coming up with his pockets full of crackers and
cookies, which were so much better than any he ever ate
before.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Don't you think just as we do, that we had a jolly time?
Ralph says he should like to live on board the tug; but I
think he would want to come home every night.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 9em;">The crosses, by her mate;</span><br />
While Billy kept the tally at the bottom of the slate.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;">When their class was heard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">They couldn't spell a word:</span><br />
They put an "i" in burly, and they put a "u" in bird!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">So, according to the rule,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">They must study after school,</span><br />
Or by and by they'll have to sit upon the dunce's stool.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;">Tit, tat, toe!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Three in a row!</span><br />
The teacher's pencil taps on the desk broad and low.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Now come," she says, "and spell;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">I'm sure you'll do it well;</span><br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;">Tit, tat, toe!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Three in a row!</span><br />
Straight to the teacher's desk the willing children go:<br />

<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Not missing as before,</span><br />

For pleasure quickly passes, while pain much longer stays.<br />

<h2><a name="keeper" id="keeper"></a>THE KEEPER PUNISHED.</h2>


<p style="text-indent: 2em"><span class="smcap">Elephants</span>, when kindly treated, become very much
attached to their keepers, and will obey their orders as
readily as good children obey their parents.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">But sometimes the keepers are cruel men, and, instead of
managing the elephants by kindness, will goad them, and
treat them badly.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">One day a new keeper was set over an elephant named
Tippoo, that had been accustomed to good treatment. This
new keeper, if he had been wise, would have won the
elephant's love by kindness.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">Instead of that, the man kept thrusting his goad at
the elephant, and hurting him without any good cause.
Tippoo bore it patiently for some time; but at last, with his
great trunk seizing his tormentor, he ran with him down to
the river that was near by.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">Here, after ducking the man several times in the water,
he laid him down gently on the dry ground, as much as to
say, "Now, sir, behave yourself, and treat me like a gentleman,
or I will give you a worse ducking than that."</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">Finding that Tippoo was not to be trifled with, the man
began to treat him well, and the elephant soon forgave him,
and at last grew quite fond of him. Love wins love.</p>

<h2><a name="neddy" id="neddy"></a>NEDDY'S SAND-BANK.</h2>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/Illus-11.png" title="Neddy's Sand-Bank" alt="Neddy's Sand-Bank" height="279" width="200" /></div>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">On</span> lovely summer afternoons, when the sky is blue, and
the sea bluer, I take my books or work, and go out to sit
under a great oak-tree
that stands at the top
of a sand-bank, which
slopes gently down to a
broad, white, beach.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">This sand-bank is a
wonderful place for the
children. Every fine day
Neddy takes his box of
playthings, and marches
off to the sand-bank; and
I think, as I kiss his dear
rosy cheeks, what a nice,
clean boy he is in his
linen blouse, broad-brimmed
hat with blue
ribbons, white stockings,
and neat buttoned boots.
He returns after a few hours, looking like a little savage.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"Just fit to go into the wash-tub," Dinah says; and she is
right.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">What do they play on the sand-bank? I will tell you
what they did yesterday, while I sat under the oak-tree and
worked, and listened to their prattle.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"Let's build cities to-day," said Tommy Abbott. "Oh,
yes!" said Jamie Newton. "I will build Boston," chimed
in Neddy: "I don't know much about other places." After
each had selected a city to build, they were silent for some
time.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>But by and by Neddy looked up, and called to me, "Oh,
do come down here, mamma, and see my Boston!" So I
climbed down the bank to visit his city. He had scooped a
hole in the sand, lined it with clay, filled it with sea-water,
and stocked it with his shining tin fish. Of course I knew
at once this was the pond on Boston Common.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/Illus-12.png" title="Neddy's Sand-Bank Picture 2" alt="Neddy's Sand-Bank Picture 2" height="502" width="400" /></div>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Jamie Newton, who studies geography, and knows all
about great cities everywhere, made a model Philadelphia,
with its long, wide streets. Jamie's streets were so clean,
and so beautifully shaded with sprigs of evergreen, that
Mary Whitman said her grandest doll, Arabella Rosetta,
should take a nice ride through them. So Rosetta was set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
up in her carriage, and one tucked the crimson afghan about
her dainty feet, while another opened her <i>very best</i> sky-blue
parasol, (for Rosetta is particular about her complexion),
and Mary put on her hat with the blue plumes, and pink
roses, smoothed down her flounces, and said, "Be a good
girl, Rosy. Don't stay out after dark, for the dew will
spoil your clothes."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/Illus-13.png" title="Neddy's Sand-Bank Picture 3" alt="Neddy's Sand-Bank Picture 3" height="470" width="400" /></div>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">By and by it grew late. The sun sank down into the
sea; while the moon, broad and full, rose from behind the
hill; and I said, "Come, Neddy, we must run home to tea."</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">But Tommy Abbott, who had built a most wonderful
Chicago, begged for a match to burn his city with. So the
children gathered a heap of sticks and dry leaves; and
Tommy set fire to the pile, and up and away flamed the
beautiful city. Then we all went up to the hotel together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and very soon tea was ready; and it was a wonderful thing
to see how the children disposed of bread and milk, baked
sweet apples, and gingerbread.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">After we went up to our room, I wrote this story, and
read it to Neddy. How his eyes sparkled with delight!
"It's just as true as I live, every word of it," he said as I
finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/Illus-14.png" title="Neddy's Sand-Bank Picture 4" alt="Neddy's Sand-Bank Picture 4" height="459" width="400" /></div>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"But, mamma, you forgot little Rose Ellsworth's town.
She made a real hill, and covered it with grass, and dotted
it all over with violets; and Daisy lent her a cow from her
'Noah's Ark;' and we made it stand up under a tree, and,
if it had only whisked its tail, it would have looked almost
alive.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"I think, mamma," he continued, "that Rose is the nicest
little girl here. I've painted her picture in my album."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">So I was not surprised, while looking over Neddy's pictures,
to see that he had wasted a great deal of paint in
trying to display Rose's pink cheeks and lovely golden hair:
He had painted her cheeks redder than the reddest cherries
you ever saw.</p>

<h2>SURF-BATHING AT CONEY ISLAND.</h2>


<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Coney Island</span>, about eight miles from the city of New
York, is four and a half miles long and about half a mile in
width. It is quite a resort in summer for those who want
to breathe the briny air of the ocean.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Charles and Laura had long been promised a visit to this
famous bathing-place, and one warm day in June their father
drove them down to the island; for there is a bridge connecting
it with the main land.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As they drove along the beach, they saw the bathers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the water, and Charles was very desirous of having a dip
in the salt sea himself; but he had no bathing-dress, and so
he had to give it up.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">It is very pleasant on a fine day in summer to stand on
the beach, and watch the waves as they come foaming up.
The children were much entertained at seeing a Newfoundland
dog rush into the water after a stick which his master
would throw far out.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">They will long remember their pleasant visit to Coney
Island; but the next time they go, they mean to take their
bathing-dresses and have a swim.</p>

<h2><a name="exciting" id="exciting"></a>AN EXCITING SCENE.</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Early</span> last spring, Mistress Jenny Wren took possession
of the little box nailed to a tree immediately in front of Mr.
Philip's house. She had not really moved in, when who
should peep in but Mr. English-Sparrow.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">He was abroad house hunting, and never mistrusted that
any one had got this house before him. He was thinking
how well it would suit himself and mate, when <i>whir-r-r-r</i>!
<i>whir-r-r-r!</i> up came Mrs. Jenny; and before he could offer
a word of excuse, she began with, "Fie, fie! I took you
for a gentleman! What business have you here?"</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
"My dear madam," began Mr. Sparrow; but Jenny
would not hear him. "Out, out with you, you saucebox,
you interloper!" she screamed; and she dashed at him
and pecked him till he beat a speedy retreat.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The next day, however, he came round again; whether
to express his regrets in due form, or to buy her off, I cannot
say; but Mrs. Jenny was unwilling to accept anything
but the most humble apology.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">One look convinced her that he didn't want her pardon,
but her house; and out she flew at his very eyes, and on
she chased as far as Mr. Philip, who was sitting at the
window, could see. But Mr. Sparrow was seen no more.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I knew Jenny Wren was spirited; but I should hardly
have thought that of her; should you!</p>

<h2><a name="make" id="make"></a>"MAKE A PIE."</h2>


<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">The</span> summer before our Mary was two years old, she and
her brother used to make pies in the sand, cutting them out
with the cover of a little tin pail, always using water to mix
them, if they could obtain it.</p>

<h2><a name="big" id="big"></a>A BIG DOG.</h2>


<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">I am</span> a big dog, and my name is Bouncer. I want to
tell you, little boys and girls, how I spend my time all the
day long. In the morning I am always the first one
awake: I take a walk around the house, and see if every
thing is right; then, perhaps, I am let into the house. I
look from one to another to see if all the family are at
home; and I am much pleased when somebody has a good
word for me, or when I get a pull from the baby's hand.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">For breakfast, the kitten and I have the leavings from
the table; but there never is half enough for both of us:
so I let her clean out the platter, while I run to see my
master off. When I get as far as the gate, he says, "Go
back!" I sit down and watch him till he is out of sight.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Then there comes the milkman. I know him well; for he
comes every morning and fills the can, and I watch it until
it is taken in. Perhaps, when the door is open, a bone is
thrown out to me. I hide it, quickly; for I see another dog
coming. He is a friend of mine. He comes quite often to
see me. We take a run around the house, and have a
quiet talk together; then he takes himself off.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">By that time I hear a team coming. I run to see if it is
coming to the house. It is a man with a load of coal. I lie
down and watch him. Perhaps I take a nap; but I sleep
with one eye open; and if it is warm, and the flies trouble
me, I have to switch my tail to keep them off.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Toward night, I station myself at the gate to watch for
my master. I run to meet him. He pats me on the head,
and says, "Good Bouncer!" I jump up and wag my tail,
and try to let him know how glad I am to see him.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">I hope you will be pleased with these extracts from the
diary of</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">Bouncer</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="young" id="young"></a>THE YOUNG CRITIC.</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 2em"><span class="smcap">Ernest</span> is five years old; and for three years he has been
a subscriber to "The Nursery," the pictures in which he
has enjoyed very much.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">Last autumn, his parents took him with them to France.
In the great city of Paris, they had rooms in a boarding-house,
where they made the acquaintance of a young
American painter, who had a studio in the building.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">Ernest was such a quiet little fellow, and was so fond of
pictures, that Mr. Norton, the artist, was always glad to see
him in his studio; for Ernest did not trouble him, but would
stand looking at the pictures for a quarter of an hour at a
time.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">One day, as he stood admiring a painting in which some
horses were represented, he noticed a fault; for Ernest was
a judge of horses: he was himself the owner of one&#8212;made
of wood. "Look here, Mr. Norton," said he, "isn't one of
the hind-legs of this horse longer than the other?"</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">Mr. Norton left his easel, and came and told Ernest to
point out in the painting what fault he meant. The little
fellow did so; and the painter exclaimed, "Why, you
little chip of a critic, you are right as sure as I'm alive!
We must make a painter of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/Illus-23.png" title="The Young Critic" alt="The Young Critic" height="756" width="500" /></div>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">Ernest is not quite old enough yet to decide whether he
will make a painter or a confectioner. The sight of the
beautiful candies and cakes which he has seen in some of
the shops, inclines him to the belief that a confectioner's lot
is the more enviable one. He thinks it must be a charming
occupation to make molasses-candy, and be able to eat as
much as he wants. He must live and learn.</p>

<h2><a name="playing" id="playing"></a><big>PLAYING HORSE.</big></h2>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Among</span> Ellen's playthings,
there is none that pleases her
more than the bright worsted
reins which her aunt bought
for her at the May fair.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"Reins!&#8212;what does a girl
do with reins?" I think I hear
somebody ask. Why, she plays
horse with them, to be sure.
She has a brother Charles. He
is the horse sometimes; and
sometimes he is the driver, and
Ellen is the horse. Either way,
it is good fun.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">One fine June day, her elder
brother, Ned, took part in the
play. He said there should be
a span of horses. He and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Charles would be the span,
and Ellen should drive. "No,"
said Ellen, "I would rather be
one of the horses."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/Illus-25.png" title="Playing Horse" alt="Playing Horse" height="371" width="400" /></div>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">So Nelly and Ned were harnessed
together, and Charley
took the reins. "Get up!" said
he, and away they went. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they crossed the lawn, they
passed a lawn-mower, and the
horse Ned shied badly. If he
had not had such a steady
horse as Nell by his side, there
might have been an accident.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As it was, Charles held him
in with a tight rein, and the two
horses came trotting back to
the starting-point at full speed.
If Charles had had a watch to
time them by, I think he would
have found that they made a
mile in less than three minutes.</p>

<h2>JACK.</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Jack</span> was not a handsome dog. His best friends could
not call him a beauty; but as he was a very wise, good
dog, we were all very fond of him.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">One afternoon, some of the younger members of the
family were sitting on the piazza, waiting for papa, who
was expected home on the five-o'clock train. Jack was
lying beside them.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">At last, the whistle sounded in the distance; and the little
four-year-old "flower of the family" said, "Run, Jack, to
meet papa at the station." Jack looked up, listened intently
for a moment, and then lay down again with a sigh
of disappointment.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"Oh, what a lazy fellow!" said six-year-old Annie. "If
mamma would only trust us to go to the station, we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
not wait, or play sleepy." But the train passed on, and
papa had not come.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">In a little while, another whistle sounded; and this time,
without a word of command, Jack sprung off the steps,
dashed down the street, and returned in a few moments,
escorting his master.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">How did Jack know that the time-table had been changed
that day, and a freight-train had taken the place of his
master's train?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Another time, an uncle, who was visiting the family, had
occasion to stay in town until the last train. Jack refused
to be shut up, and, at eleven o'clock at night, went in the
dark to the station, and escorted our guest up to the house.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">How did he know what train to meet? and what instinct
impelled him to do his part towards keeping up the courtesy
of the family?</p>

<h2>A LETTER FROM CALIFORNIA.</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Here</span> we are in Santa Cruz, in a hotel right on the beach.
We had such a lovely stage-ride over the mountains, and
enjoyed the mountain air so much, that I was almost sorry
when we arrived. I wish you could see the great madro&ntilde;a-trees
on the mountains with their dark-red wood and
beautiful green leaves. I do not believe you have any
Eastern trees so beautiful.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">On the top of the Santa Cruz mountains, where we
stopped to water the horses, there is a little house, and
while we waited there, out from the house came a man
whose face was all scarred and seamed. After we drove
away, the stage-driver told us that the man was a hunter,
known as "Mountain Charley," and that his scars were
made by a grisly-bear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Well, we have now been at Santa Cruz a week, and I
have had a good time. Every morning we go in bathing.
It is a funny sight to see everybody racing down into the
waves, and catching hold of a big rope that is stretched
from the shore a good distance into the water. The undertow
here is so strong, that it is not safe to venture away
from the rope.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Yesterday we all went to Moore's Beach to have a "clam-bake."
We rode in a big wagon; and the first thing we did,
when we got to the beach, was to pull off our shoes and
stockings, and wade in the water. Papa and Uncle John
dug the clams; while the rest of us ran about hunting for
sea-urchins and shells.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As soon as the clams were boiled, we sat down on the
beach, and unpacked the lunch-baskets. Oh, how hungry
we were! and how good every thing tasted.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">There was one lady in the party, who sat up high on the
rocks, with her kid gloves on, and her sunshade over her,
while the rest of us were running about with bare feet, and
skirts tucked up. But at lunch-time she came down from
her high place, and I saw her eating clams with as good
a relish as any of us.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Next week we are going to Pescadero, and, perhaps, I
will write to you again from there.</p>

<h2>THE PARROT WHO PLAYED THE MASTER.</h2>

<h4>A STORY WITH A MORAL.</h4>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">The</span> master of the house had gone out on business. As
he shut the door, the parrot, whose place was on a perch in
the room, thought to himself, "Hi! Now I am master
in this house, and I'll let people know it."</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
He thereupon threw his head proudly on one side, and
spread himself in a very pompous manner; then, as he had
seen his master do, broke the finest rose from the bush, and
put the stem in his bill; then looked at his gay-colored coat
in the glass, and felt as grand as a born nobleman.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Near by, on the rug, two dogs, Ami and Finette, lay asleep.
They were well-trained, obedient dogs, clean-limbed and
civil, expert in many clever tricks, but not quite a match
for the parrot in cleverness and cunning.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As soon as the latter spied them, he cried out, imitating
his master's tones, "Finette, attention! Ami, make ready!"
Whereupon Ami stood up on his hind-legs, straight as a
sentinel; while Finette hurried up, expecting to have something
thrown for him to bring back.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">There stood and stood the poor simpletons, steadfastly
looking up, while Master Poll cried sternly all the while,
"Ami, make ready! Finette, attention!" Finette became
almost wild with eagerness; and poor Ami could hardly
stand on his hind-legs any longer.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">At last the master came home, and put an end to the
torture of the poor dogs.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The moral of my story is this: whenever a simpleton
puts on airs and plays the master, there are always other
simpletons ready to obey his commands.</p>

<h2>CATSKILL-MOUNTAIN HOUSE.</h2>


<p style="text-indent: 2em;"><span class="smcap">My</span> little friend Mabel is passing the summer amid the
Catskill Mountains. These mountains are in the State of
New York, on the west side of the Hudson River.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Round Top and High Peak, two of the highest summits,
are about thirty-eight hundred feet above the level of the
sea. They are well covered with forests, and in autumn,
when the leaves begin to change, they make a very brilliant show.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The Catskill-Mountain House is finely situated on a rocky
terrace, twenty-two hundred feet above the river. It is
twelve miles from the village of Catskill, and is much resorted
to in the summer season.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The prospect from this house is quite extensive. Mabel
writes me that the view of the sunrise is grand; the air is
cool and bracing; and the sight of the tops of trees rolling
below, like a sea, for miles and miles, is a thing to remember.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
